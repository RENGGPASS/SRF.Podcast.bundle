# SRF.Podcast.bundle

**!! This is NOT an official Plex plugin from SRF !!**

Allows you to watch episodes from [SRF Podcast](http://www.srf.ch/podcasts/) with your Plex supported device as an Plex channel.

## Installation

Like most plugins, this is currently "[unsupported](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/201375863-Channels-from-Other-Sources)", so the first installation is manual. See the [official Plex documentation](https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/201187656-How-do-I-manually-install-a-channel-) for more information. The plugin will prompt you when an update is available and you will be able to install the new version directly over the plugin, since we included the [plex-channel-updater](https://github.com/kolsys/plex-channel-updater).
